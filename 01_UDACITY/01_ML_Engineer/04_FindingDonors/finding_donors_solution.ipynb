    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most *\\$50,000*, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classification), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DecisionTreeClassifier**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. [Real-world application](http://what-when-how.com/artificial-intelligence/decision-tree-applications-for-data-modelling-artificial-intelligence/): Business Management, Customer Relationship Management, Fraudulent Statement Detection, Engineering ans Energy Consumption, Healthcare Management, Fault Diagnosis\n",
    "    2. [Strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree#Advantages_and_disadvantages):\n",
    "        - Is simple to understand and interpret. People are able to understand decision tree models after a brief explanation.\n",
    "        - Have value even with little hard data. Important insights can be generated based on experts describing a situation (its alternatives, probabilities, and costs) and their preferences for outcomes.\n",
    "        - Help determine worst, best and expected values for different scenarios.\n",
    "        - Use a white box model. If a given result is provided by a model.\n",
    "        - Can be combined with other decision techniques.\n",
    "    3. [Weaknesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree#Advantages_and_disadvantages):\n",
    "        - They are unstable, meaning that a small change in the data can lead to a large change in the structure of the optimal decision tree.\n",
    "        - They are often relatively inaccurate. Many other predictors perform better with similar data. This can be remedied by replacing a single decision tree with a random forest of decision trees, but a random forest is not as easy to interpret as a single decision tree.\n",
    "        - For data including categorical variables with different number of levels, information gain in decision trees is biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.\n",
    "        - Calculations can get very complex, particularly if many values are uncertain and/or if many outcomes are linked.\n",
    "    4. I've chosen the DecisionTreeClassifier because of it's simplicity to configure and to use and it's learning performance. If this classifier performs good on the data there will be no need to use another advanced classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **AdaBoostClassifier**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Real-world application: [Viola-Jones face detector](http://mccormickml.com/2013/12/13/adaboost-tutorial/)\n",
    "    2. [Strength](http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost): AdaBoost is a powerful classification algorithm that has enjoyed practical success with applications in a wide variety of fields, such as biology, computer vision, and speech processing. Unlike other powerful classifiers, such as SVM, AdaBoost can achieve similar classification results with much less tweaking of parameters or settings.\n",
    "    3. [Weaknesses](http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost): AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. In some problems, however, it can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms. \n",
    "    4. This more advanced (compared to DecisionTree) classifier is my \"Plan B\" for the case if DecisionTree performs poor on the data. I will then use DecisionTree as a base classifier for Adaboost algorithm. I expect a good result using this it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **RandomForestClassifier**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Real-world application: One way that this could be applied to business is to take various product property variables and use a random forest to indicate potential customer interest. For example, if there are known customer interest factors such as color, size, durability, portability or anything else that customers have indicated interest in, those attributes can be fed into the data sets and analyzed on the basis of their own unique impact for multifactor analysis.\n",
    "    2. Strength:\n",
    "        - Powerful and accurate\n",
    "        - Good performance on many problems including non linear.\n",
    "    3. Weaknesses:\n",
    "        - No interpretability\n",
    "        - Overfitting can easily occur\n",
    "        - Need to choose the number of trees\n",
    "    4. I have chosen RandomForestClassifier as another advanced classifier because of it's high performance by big amount of data which we have.\n",
    "    \n",
    "With one of these three algorithms i think it will be possible to build an accurate model with a good leraning performance. I dont consider Support Vector Machines,K-Nearest Neighbors and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC) beacause i think these algorithms will consume much more time for trainig the model, even though they can also achieve a high training and testing score.

    "[AdaBoost](http://mccormickml.com/2013/12/13/adaboost-tutorial/) is a  boosting technique that builds on top of other classifiers and which combines multiple “weak classifiers” into a single “strong classifier”. A weak classifier is simply a classifier that performs poorly, but performs better than random guessing. \n",
    "Each weak classifier will be trained on a random subset of the total training set. AdaBoost assigns a “weight” to each training example, which determines the probability that each example should appear in the training set. Examples with higher weights are more likely to be included in the training set, and vice versa. After training a classifier, AdaBoost increases the weight on the misclassified examples so that these examples will make up a larger part of the next classifiers training set, and hopefully the next classifier trained will perform better on them. The process continues until a pre-set number of weak learners have been created (a user parameter) or no further improvement can be made on the training dataset. Once completed, you get a pool of weak learners each with a stage value. Predictions are made by calculating the weighted average of the weak classifiers."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
